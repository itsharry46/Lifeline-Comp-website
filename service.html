			<h3>Machine Cleaning Service</h3>
			<p>
				Keep your machine in good health with our machine cleaning service. We offer a fast, same-day service
				for all makes and models. Our machine fan cleaning services are vital for ongoing computer health. If
				your
				machine is older than two years, and has never had its fans cleaned, it’s likely to need them doing.
				Your machine fan is responsible for cooling the vital components packed tightly inside the case. It
				blows the hot air, generated by the working elements of the computer, out through the air vents. But air
				isn’t the
				only thing passing through those vents. Over time, tiny particles of dust and dirt, sucked into the
				machine
				by the action of the fan, clog up the blades.<br>

			<h3>Malware And Virus Removal</h3>
			<p>
				Most malware virus programs are designed to be hard to remove. Malware often embeds itself in windows,
				hiding its files or modifying system files with its own code. This makes it very hard for the average
				user to remove; special utilities are often required which can unmask the virus allowing for its
				deletion.
				Through years of experience we can remove the infestation without destroying your data. Your data is
				important; let us do the job.

			<h3>Hardware Updates</h3>
			<p>
				You want a faster system? Put faster parts in it. That’s the simple answer to a question that every PC
				owner asks from time to time. But replacement parts aren’t free, and cash-strapped computer enthusiasts
				know
				that the key is to put their money where it counts most. Hardware upgrades that can extend the life of
				your
				current computer. When you purchased your new Computer System, it was the latest and greatest, but six
				months later there was already a computer better and faster on the market. We can help you keep up with
				rapidly changing technology by performing simple, low cost upgrades to your existing computer. Call us
				today to find out how computer hardware upgrade can improve productivity, increase processing speed and
				keep you on the cutting edge of computer technology without purchasing a whole new desktop
				system.<br><br>

				RAM: Your computer uses RAM, random access memory, to perform functions and operations. More RAM allows
				your computer to perform more tasks simultaneously and run faster. You can boost performance by
				installing additional RAM or replacing the existing computer hardware with larger memory sticks. RAM is
				easy to replace on a desktop, but you may have to check your user’s manual for instructions to add or
				remove RAM on a laptop.<br><br>

				Hard drive: Hard drives on most laptops and desktop computers are modular and can be easily swapped for
				a faster model with a larger memory capacity. With a larger hard drive, you can store more programs,
				music and photos. You can even install more than one hard drive in a desktop computer to expand storage
				or
				back up files.<br><br>

				Optical disc drive: Upgrading to a new DVD burner or a Blu-ray disc drive will give your computer new
				capabilities. An optical drive is easy to install, and you may even be able to install multiple drives
				on the same desktop, with one drive as the master drive and a second as a “slave” drive.<br><br>

				Processor: Your processor has a large impact on the speed and performance of your laptop or desktop
				computer. It’s also a very simple component to change. Before you choose a new processor, however, check
				the processor socket type on your computer’s motherboard. Your new processor needs to match that socket
				type to be compatible.<br><br>

				Network / Servers<br><br>

				Also, if it is time to replace or upgrade one or more of your computer systems, we can advise or build
				you with new reliable computer tailored to meet your particular needs – at an affordable price without
				using cheap and nasty components. Affordable Computer Repairs will also provide a guarantee for all new
				machines supplied and installed. Planning to set up a network in your home? Our technicians at Computer
				Repairs can set up a secure wireless network in your home that will allow you to share everything
				between as many computers as you like with 100% security.<br><br>
